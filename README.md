## Github README!
This is a README file! These are used for documentation purposes on Github. They are an excellent way to share crucial information about your projects with the world like how to use your application, what technologies/methodologies you built it with etc etc. Bonus! With markdown you can write code snippets with syntax highlighting!  
  
```java
public cass Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```
